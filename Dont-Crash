#   Turtles in Traffic
#   Move turtles horizontally and vertically across screen.
#   The purpose of this code is to stop turtles when they collide and turn them around if they miss.
#   The expected output is supposed to show turtles colliding into each other to turn into different colors and turning around if they miss to collide again.
